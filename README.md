Challenge 1: Conversion Rate (Country, Age, New_User, Source, Total_pages_visited, Converted)
             The goal is to build a model that predicts conversion rate and, based on the model, come up with recommendations for 
             the product and marketing team to improve revenue.
             
Challenge 2: Spanish Translation A/B Test (User_id, Data, Source, Device, Browser_language, ads_channel, broswer, Conversion, Test, 
             Sex, Age, Country)
             The goal is to confirm that locialized translation is not the primary reason that Spain-based users have a much higher 
             conversion rate than other Spanish-speaking countries. A/B test provide other Spanish speaking countries translations 
             writter by locals. 
             
Challenge 3: Employee Retention (Employee_id, Company_id, Dept, Seniority, Salary, Join_date, quit_date)
             The goal is to predict when employees are going to quit by understaning the main derivers of employee churn. 
             
Challenge 4: Identifying Fraudulent Activities (User_id, signup_time, Purchase_time, Purchase_value, Device_id, Source, Browser, Sex,
             Age, IP_address, Class, Lower_bound_IP_address, Upper_bound_IP_address, Country)            
             The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability that the first transaction of a new user is                  fraud.

Challenge 5: Funnel Analysis (User_id, Date, Device, Sex, Home_page, Search_page, Payment_page, Payment_confirmation_page,)
             The goal is to get a full picture of funnel conversion rate for both desktop and mobile. The sequence of pages that lead 
             to conversion is called funnel. Funnel analysis allows to understand where/when users abondan the website. It gives crucial
             insights on user behavior and on wyas to improve user experience.

Challenge 6: Pricing test (User_id, Timestamp, Source, Device, Operative_system, Test, Price, Converted, City, Country, Lat)
             The goal is to evaluate whether a pricing experiment running on the site has been successful. You should focus on user                  segmentation and provide insights about segments who behave differently and actionable insights that might increase                      conversion rate.

Challenge 7: Marketing Email Campaign (Email_id, Email_text, Email_version, Hour, Weekday, User_country, User_past_purchase, )
             Email compaign optimization involves personalizing the text and/or subject, who should receive it, when should be sent,                  etc. The goal is to optimize email compaigns to maximize the probability of users clicking on the link inside the email,                which is the metric for success, improve the click through rate (defined as # of users who clock on the link/total users                who received the email), and glean interesting insights on how it performs for different user segment. 
             
Challenge 8: Song Challenge (Id, User_id, User_state, User_sign_up_date, Song_played, Time_played)
             The goal is to build a very preliminary song recommendation model in order to increase user engagement, and to set up a 
             test to check whether your model works well and is improving engagement.
             
Challenge 9: Clustering Grocery Items
             The goal is to look at user purchase history and create categories of items that are likley to be bought together and                    should belong to the same section. 
             
Challenge 10: Credit Card Transactions
              The goal is to use unsupervised learning to identify sudden clusters of unusual activities. 
              
Challenge 11: User Referral Program 
              The goal is to estimate the effectiveness of the referral program, and suggest better ways to test the program.
              
Challenge 12: Loan Granting 

Challenge 13: Json City Similarities 
              The goal is to build the foundation of personalization by identifying searches likely to happen together and cluster users               based on their session searchers. In particular, come u p with an algorithm that clusters sessions into two groups, high                 intent and low intent. 
              
Challenge 14: Optimization of Employee Shuttle 

Challenge 14: Diversity in the workforce 

Challenge 16: URL Parsing Challenge 
              The goal is to parse a sequence of URLs about user searches and extract some basic info out of it, and find the city with               the worst search algorithm. The idea here is that a great search algorithm should return all interesting results ont he                 first page and never force users to visit the other pages. 
              
Challenge 17: Engagement Test 
              The goal is to look at the A/B test results to see if the new feature increases user engagement, defined by the number of               pages visited by users on each session, and to see if such effect differs across different user segments. 
              
Challenge 18: On-line Vedio Challenge (Video_id, Count, Date, Videa_length, Video_language, Video_upload_date, Video_quality)
              The goal is to understand whether a video is hot or not. Understanding this would allow to optinize vedioes promoted on
              home-page and, therefore, maximize ads revenue. 
              
Challenge 19: Subscription Rentation Rate 

Challenge 20: Ads Analysis (Date, Shown, Clicked, Converted, Averagte_cost_per_click, Total_revenue, Ad)
              The goal of this project is to look at a few ad compaigns and analyze their current performance as well as predict future 
              performance. Explain the pros and cons of the metric you choose. Data science is used to choose which ads to show, how                   much to pay, optimize ad text and the position as well as in countless of other related applications.
